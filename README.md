## Install

Assumes that you have installed the [RS utils and dev packages](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense).

Trying out build management with [Meson and Ninja](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html).


Things that probably need to be installed:
```
sudo apt install cmake
sudo apt install ninja-build
sudo apt install librealsense-dev
sudo apt install librealsense-dbg
```

Installing `meson` should just be:
```
pip3 install --user meson
```
